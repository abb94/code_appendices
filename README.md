## 1. Architectures and Models
This section contains the model architectures used in the thesis. 

## 2. Data Extraction and Preparation
The contents of this folder include scripts frame extraction from raw videos, for data augmentation, script for landmarking and mapping techniques. 


## 3. Deployment Pipelines
This section shows the java-script for model deployment. This can be found in the App Deployment" folder. 
Additionally, the deployment scripts for Dataset 1 and Dataset 2 in Deployment Pipelines folder. 

## 4. Training and Evaluation Process
Includes the necessary functions and scripts for conducting the training and validation processes.

## 5. Test Videos
Here, you can access the test videos that were used to produce the results presented in the thesis. These videos provide practical examples of the model's performance. The videos are password-protected. The code is provided in the appendix section B.6. 

## 6. Additional Files
- The `.rar` files contain all the data used throughout the thesis. These folders are not password-protected.
